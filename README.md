# The Complete Dummy Guide to Becoming a Data Analyst (in 4 weeks) 

A chaotic documentary by a human who's trying to make sense of Excel, SQL, and life anddd still get paid (heavily) while at it. 😁


# 🎬 Okay, let's be professional
A complete guide to becoming job-ready for a Data Analyst role in 4 weeks.

## 🧭 Why This Exists
Because I was tired of “perfect tutorials.”

So I decided to document the messy, confusing, funny, and honest version of what learning data analytics actually looks like — the version where your SQL query breaks, your Excel sheet crashes, and you celebrate finally understanding joins.

If you’ve ever felt lost starting out — this is for you.  
This is my 4-week crash course in figuring it all out.  
By the end, I should (hopefully) be employable. 😂
