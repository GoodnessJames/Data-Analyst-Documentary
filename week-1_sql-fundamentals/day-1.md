#### 🧠 What I Learned
- (3–5 bullet points or mini-notes on new concepts)
- (Keep it light: “Finally understood what a JOIN really does — it’s basically matchmaking for tables.”)

#### 🤯 My Struggle Moment
- Describe what confused you or took longest to grasp.  
- Example: “Tried to join two tables, ended up breaking the entire database. Felt powerful and stupid at once.”

#### ⚡ Aha! Moment
- Capture that single “lightbulb” insight of the day.  
- Example: “CTEs are like short-term memory — super helpful when you don’t want to clutter your main query.”

#### 🧰 Tools & Commands I Used
- `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- `pandas.merge()`
- Excel: `XLOOKUP()`

#### 🎨 Mini Project / Practice Task
*(Optional, but powerful)*  
Describe any practice task you did — e.g.  
> “Built a mini dashboard of store sales using Excel Pivot Tables.”

#### 💭 Reflection
- 1–2 sentences that feel human and raw.  
> “Today was one of those days where you think you know Excel — until Excel reminds you who’s boss.”
